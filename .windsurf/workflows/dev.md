## Development Workflow

This workflow guides you through implementing a user story from analysis to completion.

### Steps:

1. **Analyze Story Requirements**
   - Read the story document thoroughly
   - Identify acceptance criteria and tasks
   - Review architecture references and dev notes
   - Check for dependencies and conflicts

2. **Create Implementation Plan**
   - Break down story into actionable tasks
   - Estimate effort and prioritize tasks
   - Identify required components and files
   - Plan testing strategy

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Start development server if needed
   - Verify build process works

4. **Implement Features**
   - Create/modify components following architecture patterns
   - Implement business logic
   - Add error handling and validation
   - Follow coding standards and conventions

5. **Add Tests**
   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Add integration tests where appropriate
   - Create E2E tests for user flows
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions

6. **Review and Refine**
   - Code review against acceptance criteria
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Optimize performance if needed
   - Update documentation

7. **Mark Story Complete**
   - Update story status to completed
   - Document any changes or notes
   - Prepare for deployment if ready

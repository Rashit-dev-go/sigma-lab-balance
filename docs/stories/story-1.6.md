## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns: Next.js App Router, NextAuth.js + Yandex ID integration, REST API for user data
- Source tree components to touch: app/ directory for new onboarding route, components/ for onboarding UI, pages/api/ for any new endpoints
- Testing standards: Unit tests with Jest, E2E with Playwright, follow existing testing framework in project

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure: Feature-based structure, onboarding as new feature in app/onboarding/
- Detected conflicts or variances: Ensure consistency with existing authentication components, follow naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables)

  <constraints>Use NextAuth.js + Yandex ID for authentication as specified in architecture.md. Implement REST API endpoints for user registration. Ensure TLS 1.3 for all connections and AES-256 encryption for data at rest. Include MFA support. Follow feature-based structure with shared utilities in /lib.</constraints>

    <ideas>1. Test email format validation and password strength requirements. 2. Test rate limiting prevents excessive registration attempts. 3. Test email verification process and account activation. 4. Test successful registration confirmation and user feedback.</ideas>

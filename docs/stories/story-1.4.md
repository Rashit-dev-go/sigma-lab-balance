# Story 1.4: ai-powered-transaction-categorization

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want transactions to be automatically categorized using AI,
so that I don't have to manually tag every transaction and can quickly understand my spending patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AI model categorizes transactions on entry
2. Categories include personal/business, income/expense types
3. User can override AI suggestions
4. Accuracy tracking for AI improvement

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement YandexGPT integration for transaction categorization
  - [x] Set up YandexGPT API client in lib/
  - [x] Create categorization prompt templates
- [x] Develop categorization logic
  - [x] Parse transaction description and amount
  - [x] Map to predefined categories (personal/business, income/expense)
  - [x] Handle edge cases and ambiguous transactions
- [x] Add user override interface
  - [x] UI component for category selection
  - [x] Update transaction with user override
  - [x] Store override for learning
- [x] Implement accuracy tracking
  - [x] Track AI vs user categorizations
  - [x] Calculate accuracy metrics
  - [x] Store metrics in database

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints: Use YandexGPT for AI analysis, ensure data security with AES-256 encryption, REST API for categorization service.
- Source tree components to touch: /lib/yandex-gpt.js, /pages/api/categorize.js, transaction model updates.
- Testing standards summary: Unit tests for categorization logic, integration tests for YandexGPT API, accuracy metrics validation.

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure: Follow feature-based structure, place AI utilities in /lib.
- Detected conflicts or variances: Ensure compliance with Russian data laws (152-ФЗ), no international AI services.

### Outcome
Approve

### Summary
The AI-powered transaction categorization implementation is comprehensive and well-executed. The YandexGPT integration provides reliable categorization, user override functionality is properly implemented, and accuracy tracking is in place for continuous improvement. All acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with strong adherence to architectural standards.

### Key Findings
- **High Severity**: None identified
- **Medium Severity**: None identified
- **Low Severity**: None identified

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- AC #1: AI model categorizes transactions on entry - Implemented with YandexGPT API integration and automatic categorization on form input
- AC #2: Categories include personal/business, income/expense types - Income/expense handled via existing type field, personal/business categorization added via AI
- AC #3: User can override AI suggestions - Override functionality implemented in transaction form
- AC #4: Accuracy tracking for AI improvement - Categorization attempts logged with accuracy metrics API

### Test Coverage and Gaps
- **Unit Tests**: Complete for YandexGPT client and API routes
- **Integration Tests**: Complete for categorization API and transaction creation with categorization
- **E2E Tests**: Basic framework implemented for transaction categorization flow
- **Security Tests**: Covered in integration tests (API validation, auth)

### Architectural Alignment
- Follows Next.js 14 and TypeScript standards
- REST API pattern with proper error responses
- YandexGPT integration follows external API best practices
- Database schema extended with categorization tracking
- Feature-based structure maintained

### Security Notes
- YandexGPT API requires proper authentication (IAM token)
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Categorization data encrypted where sensitive
- Audit logging captures all categorization operations

### Best-Practices and References
- YandexGPT integration follows official API documentation
- React form handling follows best practices with controlled components
- Database relations properly defined in Prisma schema
- Jest testing framework used correctly for unit and integration tests
- OWASP API Security guidelines followed for categorization endpoints

### Action Items
None - All requirements fully satisfied
